# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project. I built it based on my own requirements to showcase my work and skills. It is developed using **Svelte**, as it provides the freedom and flexibility to implement exactly what I need.

The UI design is inspired by [Jekyll & AcademicPages, a fork of Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
