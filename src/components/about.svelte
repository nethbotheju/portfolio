		<p>
			I am a second-year Computer Science student at the Informatics Institute of Technology,
			affiliated with the University of Westminster. I am passionate about machine learning, web
			backend technologies, and low-level programming.
		</p>

		<p>
			With a strong foundation in software development, I have worked on multiple projects spanning
			web development, machine learning, and systems programming. My technical expertise includes
			Python, Java, C, and C#, as well as modern web frameworks such as Flask, Angular, Vue.js, and
			Svelte. I am continuously exploring AI and machine learning, applying these technologies to
			real-world applications and research.
		</p>

		<p>
			Academically, I have completed CS50, Harvard University's rigorous introduction to computer
			science, and earned a distinction in my Foundation Certificate in Higher Education (IT).
			Alongside my studies, I actively contribute to open-source projects and develop software
			solutions aimed at enhancing efficiency and automation.
		</p>

		<p>
			In web development, I focus on designing scalable architectures and implementing efficient
			data processing systems. My projects range from simple web applications to advanced systems,
			such as Curasync and a Real-Time Ticketing System.
		</p>

		<p>
			Beyond web development, I have a strong interest in low-level programming. One example is
			Gity, a Rust-based alternative Git client, which highlights my passion for working with
			systems-level programming and low-level languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the field of machine learning, I have worked on projects like a Movie Prediction System,
			which leverages modern machine learning techniques to build accurate predictive models. More
			details about these and other projects can be found on my portfolio page.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am also interested in writing research papers in areas such as machine learning and quantum
			computing. Currently, I am laying the foundation for academic research and working on a
			machine learning-related research paper. Additionally, I am learning Q#, Microsoft's quantum
			programming language, and conducting simple experiments with quantum algorithms. My ultimate
			goal is to explore research opportunities that combine AI/ML with quantum computing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I actively share my knowledge and continuously learn by collaborating within the tech
			community, engaging in discussions about software engineering, AI advancements, and backend
			technologies. My work reflects a strong commitment to innovation, problem-solving, and
			leveraging technology to create impactful solutions.
