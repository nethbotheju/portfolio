	<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Project Overview</h2>
	<p>
		This is my personal portfolio website, which I developed to showcase my work, skills, and
		experiences in a professional and accessible way. The project was built entirely based on my own
		requirements, giving me full control over both the design and functionality. I chose Svelte as
		the primary framework because of its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to deliver fast,
		optimized web applications tailored to my needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The user interface (UI) design takes inspiration from Jekyll and AcademicPages, which are
		well-regarded for their minimalistic and clean layouts. In particular, I was influenced by
		<a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes" class="underline">Minimal Mistakes</a>,
		a popular theme known for its readability and focus on content.

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Technical Implementation</h2>
	<p>
		The portfolio is developed using Svelte as the front-end framework, which allows for efficient
		and reactive user interfaces. For styling, I incorporated Tailwind CSS, which provides
		utility-first classes and enables rapid development of custom, responsive designs.
